This guide is designed to help students learn the basics of building RESTful APIs using Java 17 and Spring Boot, while following a layered architecture.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of this Guide

- Introduce students to Spring Boot and its project setup using Spring Initializr.
- Teach the concept of layered architecture (Model, Service, Controller) while skipping the repository for now by using a HashMap as an in-memory database.
- Provide a hands-on exercise in creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting student records through simple GET,POST, PUT and DELETE endpoints.
- Reinforce core OOP concepts such as encapsulation (in the model) and abstraction (in the service interface).
- Explain the purpose of annotations like @Service and @RestController in the Spring ecosystem.
- Practice API testing using Postman.
